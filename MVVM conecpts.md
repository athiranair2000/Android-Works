An architecture pattern that allows fast reaction to design changes is one of the most required changes to be implemented.

The main players in the MVVM pattern are:

- The View — that informs the ViewModel about the user’s actions

- The ViewModel — exposes streams of data relevant to the View

- The DataModel — abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.
